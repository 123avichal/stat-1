As a result, it affects both the nature and the depth of insights you’re able to glean from your data.

For instance, if you classify your data at the ordinal level of measurement, you know that you can evaluate how items compare to each other based on a specific hierarchy. If you wanted to analyze the exact distance between items rather than understand only how they compare to one another, you might want to rely on data at the interval level of measurement."
